# Pitch Deck: Prakriti 🌿
> Empowering Farmers with AI & Community

---

## 1. Introduction
**"Agriculture is the backbone of our nation, but our farmers are fighting a silent war against pests, diseases, and lack of information."**

Prakriti is a revolutionary **AI-powered agricultural assistant** designed to bridge the gap between advanced technology and the rural farmer. It transforms a simple smartphone into a powerful diagnostic tool, a community center, and an expert advisor.

## 2. Problem Statement
Farmers in rural India face three critical challenges:
1.  **Delayed Diagnosis**: By the time a disease is identified, it's often too late to save the crop.
2.  **Knowledge Gap**: Lack of access to immediate, scientific advice in their local language.
3.  **Isolation**: Inability to connect with nearby farmers to share resources or warnings about local pest outbreaks.

*Current solutions are either too expensive, too complex, or require high-speed internet—leaving the small-scale farmer behind.*

**Prakriti** offers a unified platform that solves these problems with a "Mobile-First, AI-First" approach:
*   **Instant Diagnosis**: Snap a photo, get a diagnosis in seconds using computer vision.
